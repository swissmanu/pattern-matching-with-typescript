# Pattern Matching with TypeScript

> [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html) does not have any pattern matching functionality built in. This article shows several ways how you can replicate the core of a simple pattern matcher using a few simple structures and functions within TypeScript.
>
> Resulting code will have improved maintainability and better runtime type safety when done right.

This is the backing repository for the article "Pattern Matching with TypeScript" published under https://pattern-matching-with-typescript.alabor.me/

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains example code which goes along with the article read. Every example is fully executable.

You can run the examples by cloning or downloading this repository. Run `npm install` to install [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html) and [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/). `npm test` executes the test suite for the examples.

😎 Pro tip: Run `npm test -- --watch` if you want to tinker with the code and rerun the test suite automatically.
